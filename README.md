# Note
This repo is a boilerplate made by Dev Academy Aotearoa where I had graduated from. Here we exercised our knowledge of creating a full stack web app we had been educated on for 6 weeks at that time. This was a final group project where we had prouduce and present our project to our friends and family. 

Here our team chose to develop Tradie Tracker, a tool for managing tradespeople jobs effectively. Had a lot of fun collaborating with my team on this, definitely learned a lot from this project not only tech wise, but working collaboratively with people on producing a common interest.

This here is to show my learning progress and time to time recolidation on the tech stack we were using. Sometimes I even come back to it to test out something else I'm learnning and add it to this project in some way.

Below is the previous readme instructions of Dev Academy Aotearoa's repo
